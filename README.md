# 3D_CPU_Graphics.-Combined-Ray-Tracing-and-Rasterization-features

This project allows you to project any 3D object made up of 3-vertex faces using both RayTracing and Rasterization techniques. Moreover, if you want to load an obj made from N-vertex faces (where N>3),  you can modify "readObj" fucntion for that purpose.
